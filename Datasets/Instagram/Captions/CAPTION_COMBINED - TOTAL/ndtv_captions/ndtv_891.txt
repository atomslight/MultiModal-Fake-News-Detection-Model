A 28-year-old man was killed after being run over by his neighbour in Gurugram over a parking dispute, police said. The man's brother and mother were also injured in the incident, which took place on late Sunday night. Rishabh Jasuja, returning from work, had parked his car outside the residence of Manoj Bharadwaj, a resident of Sector 49. This seemingly innocuous act ignited a heated confrontation between Manoj and the Jasuja brothers.
