#NDTVWorld | US President Joe Biden dropped out of the forthcoming presidential election on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee. Former president Donald Trump on Sunday reacted to Joe Biden ending his re-election bid, claiming the incumbent president is "certainly not fit to serve." He further questioned whether the Republican Party should be "reimbursed for fraud" for the resources and money it spent campaigning against President Joe Biden.
