An aspiring doctor from the United States was left brain dead after his friends pushed him into a lake in Louisiana despite knowing he couldn't swim and then watched helplessly as he drowned.

A shocking video that is making rounds on social media shows the group staring into the lake minutes after pushing Christopher Gilbert over the dock at Lake D'Arbonne in Farmerville on April 14.
