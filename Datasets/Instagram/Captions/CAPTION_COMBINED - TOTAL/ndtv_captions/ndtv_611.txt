Mark Cuban, renowned entrepreneur and investor on the TV show Shark Tank, has garnered renewed attention for his practice of sharing profits with employees following company sales. In a recent post on X, Mr Cuban revealed that 300 of the 330 employees at Broadcast.com became millionaires when the audio streaming service was sold to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in stock in 1999. This approach extends beyond Broadcast.com, with Mr Cuban stating, "In every business I've sold, I've paid out bonuses to every employee that was there more than a year."
