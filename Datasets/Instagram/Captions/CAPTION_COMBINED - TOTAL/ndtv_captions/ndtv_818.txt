Tinkesh Kaushik, a 30-year-old man from Goa, has become the world's first triple amputee to reach the Mount Everest Base Camp located 17,598 feet above sea level, a private disability rights body has claimed.

Mr Kaushik, who completed the challenging Everest Base Camp journey on May 11, said despite his physical disabilities, he managed to achieve the feat due to his mental strength.
