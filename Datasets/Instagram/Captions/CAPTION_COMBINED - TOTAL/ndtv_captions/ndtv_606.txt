A 13-year-old boy has been detained for allegedly sending a threat mail to Delhi airport claiming that a bomb had been placed in an Air Canada flight headed to Toronto.

The boy from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut told the police he had sent the threat mail last Tuesday "just for fun". He said he got the idea from recent news on television about similar threats - later found to be fake - to schools in various cities, and wanted to test if the authorities could track him down.
