Police on her tail, Manorama Khedkar, the mother of trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar, used a fake Aadhaar card to get a room at a lodge in Maharashtra's Raigad district, sources have told NDTV. She had hired a private cab to reach the lodge and was living there with the cab driver, who she introduced as her son, the sources in police added.

Manorama Khedkar was arrested from the lodge this morning in connection with a viral video in which she is seen brandishing a firearm and threatening some villagers, reportedly over a land dispute. She faces multiple charges, including attempt to murder. A Pune court has remanded her in police custody for two days.
