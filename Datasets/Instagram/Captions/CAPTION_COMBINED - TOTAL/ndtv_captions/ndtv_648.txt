Doctors successfully removed a coin stuck in the throat of a 12-year-old boy after seven years in a rare and complex surgery. He had swallowed the coin when he was just five, his uncle said.

The surgery was performed by ENT surgeon Dr Vivek Singh and his team at the district hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi.
