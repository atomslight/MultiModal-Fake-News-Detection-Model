#Gujarat | As the ash settles at the Rajkot game zone site, where 27 people died in a massive fire on Saturday evening, the faces behind the numbers are coming to the fore. The DNA test results of the charred bodies are coming in, as families of those still missing keep hoping against hope.

8 members of the Jadeja family had stepped out for a weekend outing at the TRP game zone. Five of them, three in the 10-15 years age group, never made it home.
