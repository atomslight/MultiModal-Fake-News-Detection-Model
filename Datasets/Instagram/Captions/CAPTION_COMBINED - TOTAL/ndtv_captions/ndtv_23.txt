Are you tired of being told to substitute white sugar with supposedly healthier options like honey, jaggery and coconut sugar? Think again! Nutritionist Sonakshi Joshi has shattered this myth, declaring that “all of these options are pretty much the same.” According to Ms Joshi, regardless of the type of sugar, it breaks down to glucose in the body, triggering a similar insulin response. This means that consuming jaggery or honey won't spare your insulin levels, while refined sugar won't necessarily cause a drastic spike. The Nutritionist, in a video posted to her Instagram, explains that these sugar alternatives have a comparable glycemic index and are essentially “anti-calories.”
