#Opinion | "Coriander foam as a garnish or flamb√©ed gulab jamun are often misrepresented as examples of 'modern Indian' cuisine. Further dilution is evident in offerings like Maggi with cheese, or paneer makhani pizza.

But renowned chef Gaggan Anand defines 'Modern Indian' cuisine as a personal memory of Indian food, reinterpreted with ingredients and techniques that evoke the experience of childhood dishes, such as 'Chhole Bhature'. It's a reimagining of traditional dishes with new, complex flavours. Think ingredients such as bhoot jholakia chillies, kokum, amaranth, and gucchi mushrooms, being juxtaposed with popular international ingredients like caviar, foie gras, truffles, quail eggs, and quinoa."
