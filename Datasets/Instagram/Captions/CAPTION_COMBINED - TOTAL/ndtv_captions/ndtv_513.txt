Congress's Rahul Gandhi, in a series of strong remarks about the row over medical entrance exam NEET-UG 2024 (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), said today that paper leaks will continue in the country as long as the universities remain "captured" by the BJP. A paper leak, he added, is an "anti-national activity" since it "hugely hurts the country's young people, who are the country's future".
