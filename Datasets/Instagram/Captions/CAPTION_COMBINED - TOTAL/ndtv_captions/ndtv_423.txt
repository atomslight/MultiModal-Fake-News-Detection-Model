Modus Operandi In Dating App Scams: In dating app scams, victims match with a woman on platforms like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OKCupid. She quickly shares her WhatsApp number and they plan a date, insisting on meeting at a specific locality. When the victim asks for the cafe's name, she directs him to a particular Metro station.

At the cafe, she places an order, sometimes for items not on the menu, and may fake an emergency to leave. When the bill arrives, it's much higher than expected. On protesting, the victim is threatened by the cafe staff or bouncers. Left with little choice, he pays. Police said this scam thrives on an elaborate mechanism involving several players -- cafe owners, managers and women who lure the target.
