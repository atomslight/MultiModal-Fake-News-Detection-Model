#NDTVWorld | SpaceX has confirmed that 20 satellites – blasted off the Flacon 9 rocket from California, US on Thursday — will crash back to Earth. The company said that there had been a liquid oxygen leak developed in the second stage.

In a statement released on its official website, the company said, “Falcon 9's second stage performed its first burn nominally, however a liquid oxygen leak developed on the second stage. After a planned relight of the upper stage engine to raise perigee – or the lowest point of orbit – the Merlin Vacuum engine experienced an anomaly and was unable to complete its second burn.”
