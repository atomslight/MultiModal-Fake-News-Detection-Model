The speeding BMW that hit a scooter in Mumbai's Worli this morning, leading to a woman's death, was being driven by the 24-year-old son of a senior leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, police have said. The police also suspect that Mihir Shah, who is on the run, was drunk at the time of the incident. His blood test report is awaited.

The accused is the son of Rajesh Shah, deputy leader of the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra's Palghar district. The politician and his driver, Rajendra Singh Bijawat, were arrested in the evening for not cooperating with the police, among other charges, and will be produced in court tomorrow.
