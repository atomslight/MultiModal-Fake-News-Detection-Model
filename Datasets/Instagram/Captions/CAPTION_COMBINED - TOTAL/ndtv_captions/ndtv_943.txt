Delhi Capitals captain Rishabh Pant has been suspended by the IPL governing body for one match, according to a release by the BCCI on Saturday afternoon. It means that Pant, an important cog in DC's wheel if they are to keep their IPL playoffs ambition alive, will miss the side's next game against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Sunday.

DC are currently fifth in the IPL table with 12 points from as many games.
