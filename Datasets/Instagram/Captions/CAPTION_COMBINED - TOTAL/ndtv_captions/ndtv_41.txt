Employees quit their jobs for several reasons. It could be due to insufficient pay, flexible policies, lack of growth, poor work-life balance, toxic environment or simply dissatisfaction at work. Whatever the reason is, a resignation is given by an employee. But a new workplace trend is emerging where an employer asks you to resign. This is known as forced resignation, where the firm either asks you to resign with no option or be terminated.
