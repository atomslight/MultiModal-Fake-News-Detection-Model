A woman driving to work in Noida encountered a scary incident that left her shaken. The woman, Vanchha Garg, was stuck in traffic jam around 10am near Parthala Chowk last week when two men suddenly appeared on two sides of her car. One of them told Ms Garg that she has hit a child and warned her not to drive further as the child is stuck under the rear wheel of her car. The other one, meanwhile, started banging on the car window, accusing her of actually hitting someone.
