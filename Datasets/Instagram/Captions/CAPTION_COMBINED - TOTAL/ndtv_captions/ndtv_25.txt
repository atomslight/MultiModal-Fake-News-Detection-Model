American rapper Flavor Flav and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian have teamed up to sponsor US track and field athlete Veronica Fraley, who recently shared her struggle to pay rent despite qualifying for the Paris Olympics. Ahead of her debut at the Summer Olympics, Mr Fraley took to X (formerly Twitter) to share her pressing concern. "I compete in the Olympic Games TOMORROW and can't even pay my rent," the 24-year-old wrote on the microblogging site on Thursday, adding that her school just sent 75% of her rent.
