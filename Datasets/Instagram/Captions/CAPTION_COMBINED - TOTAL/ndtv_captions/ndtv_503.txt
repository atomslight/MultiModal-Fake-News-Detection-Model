Josef Mengele, known as the "Angel of Death", is a haunting figure remembered for his atrocities at Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. He gained the name for performing deadly experiments on prisoners at the Nazi concentration camp. Born on March 16, 1911, in Gunzburg, Germany, he studied medicine and anthropology at the University of Munich and received his doctorate in 1935.

His medical experiments were infamous for their extreme cruelty and lack of scientific value. He specifically focused on twins, believing that studying them could reveal genetic information useful to Nazi beliefs. Victims, including children and adults, endured surgeries, injections and other painful procedures without any form of pain relief, often leading to excruciating deaths. He even attempted to change eye colour through injections. These experiments were conducted without the consent of the victims.
