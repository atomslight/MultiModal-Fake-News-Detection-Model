Frustrated by the extreme heat, students at an educational institute in Amritsar staged a unique protest to demand air conditioning in their dorm rooms.

A video, reportedly from IIM Amritsar, shows students sleeping in the institute's mess as a mark of silent protest against the management's failure to provide adequate cooling facilities in the dorms amid the heatwave.
