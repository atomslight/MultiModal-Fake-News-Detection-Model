ISRO Chairman S Somanath today advised setting up libraries in temples, stating that such an initiative would help attract youngsters to places of worship. Speaking after receiving an award instituted by the Sree Udiyannoor Devi Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Mr Somanath said "Temples should not only be places where elderly people come for nama japa (chanting the name of God), but they should also become places for transforming society."
