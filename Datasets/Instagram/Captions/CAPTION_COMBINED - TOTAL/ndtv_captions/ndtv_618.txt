A 17-year-old girl in the UK was rushed to the hospital after a hole burst in her lung after she vaped the equivalent of 400 cigarettes a week. According to Metro, the incident happened on May 11 when the teen named Kyla Blythe collapsed and turned 'blue' during a sleepover at a friend's house.

Her lung collapsed because excessive vaping had burst a small air blister known as a pulmonary bleb on her lungs. Ms Blythe then underwent a five-and-a-half-hour surgery to remove part of her lung.
