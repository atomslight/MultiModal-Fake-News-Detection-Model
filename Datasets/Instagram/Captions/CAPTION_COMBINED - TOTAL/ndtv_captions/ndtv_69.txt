25-year-old Tanya Soni liked poetry, was a regular at cultural events in college and determined to crack the UPSC entrance exam and join the civil services. But a visit to the library on a rainy day cut her life -- and her dreams -- short. Tanya is among the 3 civil service aspirants who died after rainwater flooded the basement of Rau's IAS Study Circle in Delhi's Rajendra Nagar on Saturday.

The 25-year-old was originally from Bihar's Aurangabad, but had been in Delhi since she joined college. After completing a Bachelor's degree in political science, she was preparing for the IAS entrance exam. Tanya's body is on its way to her Bihar home for the last rites.
