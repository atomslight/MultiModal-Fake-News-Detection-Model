The Congress's win in the Allahabad Lok Sabha seat in this election has ended a 40-year dry patch for the party in the constituency. The last time the Congress won this seat, its MP was none other than megastar Amitabh Bachchan. As the INDIA Opposition bloc pulled off a stunner in Uttar Pradesh by winning 43 out of 80 seats in this election, Congress's Ujjwal Raman Singh defeated the BJP's Neeraj Tripathi by over 58,000 votes.
