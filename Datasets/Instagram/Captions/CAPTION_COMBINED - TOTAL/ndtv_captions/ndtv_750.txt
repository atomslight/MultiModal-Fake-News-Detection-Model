Celebrities, sportspersons, and millions of other social media users across the globe have been sharing the 'All Eyes On Rafah' to bring focus on Israel's air strikes in Rafah, a southern city in war-torn Gaza. At least 45 civilians, including children, were killed at a refugee camp in Rafah in an Israeli air strike to destroy Hamas. The incident has triggered international outrage, deepening the global isolation facing Israel over the war in Gaza.

Israel though in response has shared an image of its own asking people why they did not post about the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
