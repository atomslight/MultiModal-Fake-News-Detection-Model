Alphabet-owned Google recently started laying off an unspecified number of employees, marking the latest cuts at the technology giant as it cracks down on costs. Some outlets claim that Google laid off its entire Python team, a move aimed at reducing costs by hiring cheap labour outside the US. A former Google employee recently took to LinkedIn and described the night he learnt about his layoff along with his manager and some members of the team.
