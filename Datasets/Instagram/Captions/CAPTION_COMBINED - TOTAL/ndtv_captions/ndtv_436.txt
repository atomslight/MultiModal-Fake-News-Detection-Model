An Indian student was arrested and deported after it came to light that he falsified documents to obtain a full scholarship. Aryan Anand, a student at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, boasted about building "his life and career on lies" in a now-deleted Reddit post, which was later flagged by a platform moderator. Anand made a stunning confession about how he used fraudulent means to secure admission to a US college with a full scholarship.
