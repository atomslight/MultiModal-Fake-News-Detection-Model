A man's derogatory comment about Smriti Singh, the widow of Kirti Chakra awardee Captain Anshuman Singh, has left social media fuming with users demanding action against the person.

National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the comment and written a letter to Delhi Police demanding immediate and appropriate action against the man. The comment appears on a photo of Mrs Singh at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, where she received the award for her husband who died while trying to save his colleagues at an Indian Army camp in Siachen glacier.
