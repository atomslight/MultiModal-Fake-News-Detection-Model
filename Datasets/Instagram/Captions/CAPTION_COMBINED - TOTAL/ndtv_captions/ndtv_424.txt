Emotional India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who was in tears after Men in Blue sealed T20 World Cup glory, opened up on the challenging six months leading up to the marquee event and said that he had kept quiet not speaking a word. Speaking to the broadcaster after the game, Pandya reflected on the previous six months and revealed that he had not lost his temper once when things were going wrong, which was precisely why the victory felt all the more meaningful.

Mumbai Indians (MI) supporters and social media trolls were harsh on Pandya during IPL 2024. MI brought him back after a two-year stint with Gujarat Titans (GT), where he won the title in 2022. However, replacing Rohit Sharma as captain led to massive backlash for Pandya and the franchise.
