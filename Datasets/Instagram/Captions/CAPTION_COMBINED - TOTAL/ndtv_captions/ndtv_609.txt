It's an unwritten norm to let ambulances pass. Other vehicles on the road often allow those carrying patients to overtake them. But an opposite and unimaginable incident near Bengaluru has shaken the pillars of humanity.

An ambulance driver was pulled up by another driver on the road for the mere reason that it had overtaken them. He did not just face their anger but was also allegedly beaten up. As the road rage incident turned violent, a baby waited inside the ambulance to reach the hospital.
