An Indian-American doctor who drove his Tesla off a cliff in the US with his wife and two children inside - in an alleged attempt to murder them - will not be serving any jail time for now and will receive mental health treatment.

Dharmesh Patel, a radiologist in California, drove his car, carrying his wife Neha and two children aged 7 and 4, off a cliff last year after suffering from a psychotic breakdown, psychologists told the court. Mr Patel believed his children were at risk of being sex trafficked which led him to crash the car, they said.
