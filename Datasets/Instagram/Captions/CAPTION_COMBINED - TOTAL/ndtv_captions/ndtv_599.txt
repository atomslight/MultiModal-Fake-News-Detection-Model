Two terrorists who opened fire in a village in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district last evening had gone door-to-door asking for water, but the alert villagers shut the doors in their faces, the police said while sharing chilling details of the terror attack. One of the terrorists was gunned down in an encounter that began overnight while a hunt for the second one has dragged into the morning. A paramilitary soldier was also killed in action.
