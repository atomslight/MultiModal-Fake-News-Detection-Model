The parents of a nine-year-old boy from Shahapur in Maharashtra's Thane district have complained to the police that doctors at a government-run hospital wrongly performed a surgery on his genitals instead of an injured leg. Following their allegation, a health official assured an inquiry into the episode, and the police said they are carrying out an investigation.

The minor's parents said, "The boy suffered an injury on his leg while he was playing with his friends last month. He was admitted to the sub-district hospital in Shahapur on June 15 and was undergoing treatment. The doctors recently performed a circumcision surgery on his private part instead of the injured leg."
