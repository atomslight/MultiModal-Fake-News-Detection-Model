While strolling through markets, we often come across random pictures hung up on the walls of shops. These pictures have a way of grabbing your attention and making you smile or chuckle. Recently, an X (formerly Twitter) user stumbled upon an interesting picture that left her in stitches.

The image, which quickly went viral, shows a wide-eyed woman's frame hanging at a vegetable shop in Bengaluru.
