A police officer's bravery helped foil a â‚¹ 4-crore robbery attempt by a seven-member gang at a jewellery shop in West Bengal's Raniganj last week. Visuals captured by a CCTV camera right outside the shop show Sub-Inspector Meghnad Mondal exchanging fire with the robbers from behind an electric pole.
