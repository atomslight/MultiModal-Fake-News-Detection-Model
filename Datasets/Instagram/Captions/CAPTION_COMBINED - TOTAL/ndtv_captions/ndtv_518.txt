The civic authority in Gujarat's Jamnagar ordered an inquiry on Wednesday after a dead frog was allegedly found in a packet of potato wafers.

The complaint came days after a Mumbai resident claimed to have found a piece of human finger in the ice cream he had ordered online.

Samples of the production batch of the wafer packet will be collected as part of the probe, said an official of the Jamnagar Municipal Corporation.
