A new study has claimed that night owls, people who tend to be awake late into the night, perform better on cognitive tests as compared to those who are early risers, as per a report in the New York Post. The study was conducted by Imperial College London and the researchers used UK Biobank data from more than 26,000 people to understand how sleep duration, patterns and quality affect mental sharpness and cognitive capacity.
