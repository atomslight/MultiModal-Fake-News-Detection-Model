He is illiterate, but that didn't stop him from leveraging technology to commit a string of heinous crimes.

Using an app to morph his voice, Brajesh Kushwaha, a former mill worker, would pose as a woman teacher from a college and fool tribal college students from Madhya Pradesh's Sidhi district into believing that she would help them get a scholarship. In a female voice, Kushwaha would tell the students to go to a deserted area where she would send a man to meet them and bring them to her house on a motorcycle. Kushwaha would show up, take the students to a forest and rape them.
