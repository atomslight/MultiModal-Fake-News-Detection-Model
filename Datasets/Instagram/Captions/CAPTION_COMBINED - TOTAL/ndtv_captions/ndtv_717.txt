#ElectionsWithNDTV | Exit polls have predicted a clear victory for the BJP and the NDA, with most of them giving the alliance over 350 Lok Sabha seats, but AAP's Somnath Bharti disagrees - strongly.

The MLA, who is also the INDIA alliance's candidate for the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat, has said that all exit polls will be proven wrong on Tuesday, when the votes are counted, and he will shave his head if Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister for the third time.
