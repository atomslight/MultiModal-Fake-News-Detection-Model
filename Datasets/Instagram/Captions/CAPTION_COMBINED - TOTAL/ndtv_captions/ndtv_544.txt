A businessman from England is suing Apple after his wife found out "deleted" messages he sent to sex workers on their family iMac. The messages, which he believed were "deleted permanently" from his iPhone, led to his wife filing for divorce. The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, had been using iMessage to communicate with sex workers, claiming he had deleted the evidence from his iPhone. However, the messages were still accessible on the iMac due to the synchronisation of the family's devices with the same Apple ID.
