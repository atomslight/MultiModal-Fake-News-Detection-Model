The cake linked to the death of a 10-year-old Punjab girl was baked with a high concentration of artificial sweetener, officials said on Monday. On March 24, the girl's entire family fell ill after eating the chocolate cake that was ordered online from a bakery in Patiala for her birthday.

A sample of the cake was collected for testing and the report shows a high amount of saccharine, a sweet-tasting synthetic compound, was used to cook it, District Health Officer, DHO Dr Vijay Jindal told NDTV.
