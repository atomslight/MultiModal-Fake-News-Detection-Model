Opinion | "Delhi has a habit of slinking into complacency when 'terrible' becomes just 'bad'. Yes, it's a hot day, but it's not as bad as yesterday. Our collective memory of heat and dust is rather short.

Delhi goes on. As long as the privileged get their draft of cool air from their car ACs, they don't care who drops dead next to their boiling vehicle. Delhi builds, Delhi sizzles, Delhi dies. Often, it's not the same Delhi."
