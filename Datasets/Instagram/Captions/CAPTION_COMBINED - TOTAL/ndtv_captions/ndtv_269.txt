United States Vice President Kamala Harris and the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi had a telephonic conversation on Thursday evening, some reports said while social media saw strong buzz over Rahul's interaction with the US V-P of Indian descent, widely seen as a possible candidate in the upcoming Presidential elections if Biden pulls out.

However, the fake claim stands debunked. The office of US V-P has denied any such phone conversation and termed the news as â€˜inaccurate', confirmed a senior US-based scribe.
