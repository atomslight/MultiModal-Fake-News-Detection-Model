3 years after businessman Vinod Bharara was shot dead in Panipat, a WhatsApp message and a police officer's keen eye revealed a murky plot allegedly orchestrated by the victim's wife, Nidhi. New investigation led to the arrest of Dev Sunar, a truck driver, and Sumit, a gym trainer close to Nidhi. This breakthrough came after Vinod's brother, Pramod, raised suspicions from Australia.

Nidhi Bharara, Vinod Bharara's wife and mother of their daughter, met Sumit at a gym she frequented. The two grew close and an affair began. Vinod reportedly got wind of this and confronted his wife, which led to frequent arguments at home. The businessman also had face-offs with Sumit and asked him to stay away from his wife. As the altercations continued, Nidhi and Sumit allegedly plotted to kill Vinod, the probe has found.
