Lasse Stolley, a 17-year-old German boy who lives on a Deutsche Bahn railcar for the price of a yearly unlimited ticket of about $10,000 (Rs 8.3 lakh approximately) is gaining attention worldwide for being a "trainsquatter." Travelling an estimated 600 kilometres a day around Germany and Europe, the teenager rides first class, sleeps on overnight trains, eats breakfast in the dining car, does laundry in sinks, and takes showers at community centres and public swimming pools along the way, as per a report in the New York Post.
