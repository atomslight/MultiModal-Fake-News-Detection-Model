A sperm donor in the US also known as ''The Sperminator'' recently welcomed his 165th child into the world. Ari Nagel, a 48-year-old math professor from Brooklyn has children in almost all the continents of the world. Last Wednesday, he celebrated his latest child, delivered by a mother in Connecticut ahead of Father's Day. However, Mr Nagel said he will officially retire as a sperm donor when he turns fifty.

The donor has 10 women currently pregnant in the US, Canada, Asia, Africa and Europe.
