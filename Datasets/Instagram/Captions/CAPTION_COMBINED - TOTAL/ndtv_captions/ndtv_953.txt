A 16-year-old girl was allegedly beheaded by the man she was set to marry on Thursday, hours after authorities stopped their engagement ceremony in Karnataka's Madikeri. The man took the chopped head with him when he fled the scene, police said. 32-year-old Prakash was set to marry Meena, who cleared her Class 10 exams yesterday, at Surlabbi village in Madikere. However, someone informed the Child Welfare Department about the illegal ceremony.
