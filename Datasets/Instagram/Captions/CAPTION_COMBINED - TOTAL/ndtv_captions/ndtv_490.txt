Four members of Britain's richest family, the Hindujas have received jail sentences by a Swiss court on Friday for exploiting Indian staff at their Geneva mansion. The family members were accused of seizing the workers' passports, barring them from leaving the villa and forcing them to work very long hours for a pittance in Switzerland, among other things.
