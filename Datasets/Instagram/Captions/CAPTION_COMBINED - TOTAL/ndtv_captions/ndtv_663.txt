Their fathers came together under the Janata Party canopy during the anti-Emergency protests, and then diverged to create their distinct political identities. Their sons got a launch pad, but had their work cut out. Three sons stepping out of their fathers' shadows is one of the biggest stories of this Lok Sabha election.

The fathers are late Ram Vilas Paswan, late Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav, and the sons Chirag Paswan, Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav.
