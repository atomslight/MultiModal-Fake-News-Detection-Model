A 63-year-old man in Singapore is under investigation for allegedly confining his 15-year-old daughter to a tiny market stall for nearly a year. According to reports, the man allegedly made his teenage daughter live in one of the three stalls he rented at the wet market for 11 months. The 15-year-old was discovered when a neighboring stall owner smelled excrement and reported it to Singapore's National Environment Agency.
