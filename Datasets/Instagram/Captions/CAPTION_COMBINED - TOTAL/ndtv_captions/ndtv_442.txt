Ex-Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren - arrested in January in a money laundering case - has been granted bail by the High Court. Mr Soren was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate, which alleged the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader ran a scheme to manipulate records, via fictitious transactions and forged documents, to acquire a large tract of land worth several crore rupees.
