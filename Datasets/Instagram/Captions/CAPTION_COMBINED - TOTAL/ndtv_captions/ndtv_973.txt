A woman wanted to satiate her food cravings and ordered a Paneer Tikka sandwich from an eatery through a food-delivery app. Her dinner arrived from 'Pick Up Meals by Terra' in Gujarat's Ahmedabad. But instead of a Paneer Tikka sandwich, the restaurant delivered a sandwich with chicken.

The woman has written to the Deputy Health Officer of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, filing a complaint against the eatery. Meanwhile, the Food Department has imposed a ₹ 5,000 fine against the restaurant but the woman told India Today, "The incident was very dreadful and it can't be reversed. ₹ 5,000 fine is not enough and I will go to the consumer court."
