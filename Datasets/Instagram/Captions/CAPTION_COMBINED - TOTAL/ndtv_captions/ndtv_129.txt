The King's Guards are renowned for their meticulous routine and discipline, tasked with protecting various locations throughout the UK, including Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, where they attract many tourists.

Recently, a video of a King's Guard horse biting a tourist has gone viral. The footage shows the woman being bitten as she poses for a photo outside the London museum, causing her to scream in pain and rush away while others check her for injuries. "She got a really bad injury," a man in the clip said.
