Three-time BJP MP Om Birla was elected Lok Sabha Speaker for the second time in a row today after the NDA candidate won the election by a voice vote.

The election also saw a moment of rare bonhomie between the treasury and Opposition benches as Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi walked up to Mr Birla to congratulated him and also shook hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
