Former Union minister and the Congress' Lok Sabha candidate from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh Kantilal Bhuria on Thursday courted controversy by claiming men with two wives stand to gain ₹ 2 lakh under his party's Mahalaxmi scheme to give ₹ 1 lakh annually to poor women.

The statement drew a sharp response from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which sought action from the Election Commission of India against Bhuria.
