Billionaire Elon Musk's X has asked its sacked employees in Australia to return the money it claims was accidentally overpaid to them, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, acknowledged its error in currency conversion from the US to Australian dollars on the payments and asked its former employees to repay amounts of up to $70,000 in some cases, the report said on Wednesday.
