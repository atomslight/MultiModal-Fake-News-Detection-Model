In a disturbing development, Canadian rapper Drake's Toronto mansion was targeted in an alleged break-in attempt just one day after a security guard on the property was shot, according to The Guardian. Police were called to the residence on Wednesday after reports of a suspect attempting to enter the property. The suspect was apprehended without further incident, and thankfully, no injuries were reported.
