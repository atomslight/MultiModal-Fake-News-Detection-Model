Terror has gripped an area in Bareilly after a busy road became the stage for an hour-long shootout this morning, culminating in a man running over another before driving into what appears to be a large sewer. Adding to the sense of insecurity felt by residents is the fact that a few police officials allegedly arrived at the spot while the shots were being fired, but chose to remain mute spectators.
