The investigation into an 82-year-old man's death in a hit-and-run in Nagpur has uncovered a grisly murder conspiracy allegedly hatched by his daughter-in-law for family property worth â‚¹ 300 crore. Archana Manish Puttewar, assistant director in the town planning department, was arrested last week, over a fortnight after her father-in-law Purushottam Puttewar was run over by a car.
