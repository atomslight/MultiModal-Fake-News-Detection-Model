An extra-marital affair, a deadly clash, and lives shattered in the wake of a lover's fury - Ghaziabad's latest crime story looks like a page taken out of a David Baldacci novel. The victim, an 18-year-old woman named Jyoti, had travelled from her in-laws' home in Uttar Pradesh's Babrala town to care for her ailing mother, Champa Devi who is a cancer patient, in Ghaziabad's Indirapuram area.

Lalitesh, Jyoti's husband and an e-rickshaw driver accompanied her to Champa Devi's home. On Tuesday, a man identified as Bobby unleashed a frenzied knife attack on Champa Devi. In an attempt to shield her, Jyoti and Lalitesh intervened, only for Jyoti to die in the clash, and Lalitesh to sustain serious injuries. The couple had married just six months ago.
