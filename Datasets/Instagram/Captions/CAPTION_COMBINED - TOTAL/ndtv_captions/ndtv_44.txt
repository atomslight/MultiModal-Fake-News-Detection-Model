As Israel's war in Gaza rages, a growing number of parents in Israel are demanding sperm from the bodies of their sons, who were killed during the ongoing conflict, to be extracted and frozen, a BBC report said. Since Hamas' all-out offense on October 7 and Israel's brutal retaliation, over 400 Israelis have been killed.

Of these, sperm has been retrieved from as many as 170 men - both civilians and soldiers - according to the Israeli health ministry. This marks a 15 times rise as compared to previous years.
