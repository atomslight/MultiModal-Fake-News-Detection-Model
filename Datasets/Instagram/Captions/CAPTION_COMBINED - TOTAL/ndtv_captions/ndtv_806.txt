A five-year-old boy from Long Island, Jordan Marotta, who was born without a left hand, has become the youngest recipient of a top-of-the-line bionic arm. The bionic arm, designed in 'Iron Man' red and gold at Jordan's request, has earned him superhero status, according to The New York Post.

Normally, these advanced prosthetic arms are given to older children. However, Daniel Green, a certified prosthetist and orthotist at Open Bionics, explained that Jordan's physical development and emotional maturity made him an ideal candidate, setting a new record.
