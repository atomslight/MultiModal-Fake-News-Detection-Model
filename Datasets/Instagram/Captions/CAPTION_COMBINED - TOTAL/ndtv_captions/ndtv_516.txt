Chilling details, each more than the last, are emerging in the murder case of a 33-year-old man who was tortured and killed allegedly by popular Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, co-star Pavithra Gowda, and his fans. The cops believe Renuka Swamy was beaten with sticks and tied up and given electric shocks. He died due to "shock haemorrhage as a result of multiple blunt injuries," said his autopsy report.
