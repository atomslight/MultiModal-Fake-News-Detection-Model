Colonel Waibhav Anil Kale (Retd), the Indian national who was working with the United Nations (UN) as a security service coordinator, was killed after the vehicle he was travelling in came under attack in Gaza's Rafah region. Colonel Kale's killing marks the UN's first international casualty since the Israel-Hamas conflict began last year.

The UN and Israel have both called for investigations into the incident. Colonel Kale, who retired from the Indian Army in 2022, is survived by his wife Amruta and two teenage children, son Vedant and daughter Radhika.
