There was little disbelief among students of a government school in Rajasthan's Kota when two of their mates came bearing the signs of a newlywed bride. Teachers suspected the obvious but chose to overlook it.

Rani and Pinki (name changed), aged 15 and 16, were married at their home with full fanfare in Hanuman ji Ka Jhopda village on July 15, two days before the annual wedding season would expire.
