Mohammed Shami, one of India's top fast bowlers, has faced significant challenges both on and off the field. He was India's leading wicket-taker in the last three ODI World Cups, but his personal life also made headlines.

Shami went through a tumultuous separation from his wife, Hasin Jahan, who accused him of domestic violence and match-fixing. Although he was cleared of these allegations, Shami's friend Umesh Kumar revealed on Shubhankar Mishra's podcast that Shami contemplated suicide during that period.
