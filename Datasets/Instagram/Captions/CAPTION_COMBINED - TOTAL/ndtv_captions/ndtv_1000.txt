An 11-year-old boy died after being struck by a cricket ball on his genitals in the Lohegaon area of Maharashtra's Pune last week.

The victim, identified as Shambhu Kalidas Khandve alias Shaurya was enjoying a game of cricket with his friends, making the most of the ongoing summer holidays from school. However, what started as an innocent pastime turned into a nightmare when a routine play took a devastating turn. As Shaurya was bowling, a powerful strike from the batter sent the ball hurtling towards him with unexpected force, directly hitting him in his private parts.
