The Andhra Pradesh Police have filed a case against a dancer for killing a hen by biting off its head during a performance. The police in the state's Anakapalli district registered the case on a complaint by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India.

After learning about a video of a man deliberately killing a hen by biting off its head with his teeth during a dance performance in full public view, PETA India worked with senior cops to get an FIR registered.
