MS Dhoni fans were treated to a vintage innings from the former Chennai Super Kings captain on Friday at the Ekana Stadium. LSG star opener Quinton de Kock's wife, Sasha, was among the spectators, witnessing the crowd erupt into a loud cheer for Dhoni as decibel levels rose.

Sasha posted an image on Instagram stories with the captain, "When MS Dhoni comes out to bat." Along with the caption she posted an image of a notification on her smartwatch saying, "Loud environment - Sound level hits 95 decibels. Just 10 minutes at this level can cause temporary hearing loss."
