The Delhi High Court today halted Arvind Kejriwal's anticipated release on bail after an urgent petition filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) just hours before the Delhi Chief Minister was set to leave Tihar jail. The court said till it heard the probe agency's petition, which could take another 2-3 days, Mr Kejriwal would remain in jail.
