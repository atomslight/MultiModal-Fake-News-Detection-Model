Pakistan's T20 World Cup journey came to a disappointing conclusion on Friday, with the team failing to qualify for the Super 8 stage of the tournament.

Pakistan's elimination came after the United States of America's game against Ireland was washed out due to rain.

Pakistan needed Ireland to beat the USA heading into their final game of the group stage against the Irish.

Following Pakistan's exit, former pacer Shoaib Akhtar expressed disappointment over the outcome.
