It may have failed to get a majority on its own, but the BJP has managed to make inroads in a state that has rejected it in Lok Sabha elections throughout its history. National award-winning Suresh Gopi won the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat for the saffron party, ensuring that it opened its account in Kerala. Up against two strong candidates in the CPM's VS Sunilkumar and the Congress' K Muraleedharan, Mr Gopi managed to win the seat by 74,686 votes.
