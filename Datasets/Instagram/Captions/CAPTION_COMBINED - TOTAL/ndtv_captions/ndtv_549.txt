Former opening batter Gautam Gambhir's appointment as the head coach of the Indian men's cricket team is all but confirmed. For months, Gambhir has linked with the India coach job, with current boss Rahul Dravid's contract set to expire after the ongoing T20 World Cup. According to report in Dainik Bhaskar, Gambhir's appointment will be made official by the BCCI in the coming days. After being approached by the BCCI, Gambhir accepted the offer, but laid down a few demands, which have been accepted by the board.
