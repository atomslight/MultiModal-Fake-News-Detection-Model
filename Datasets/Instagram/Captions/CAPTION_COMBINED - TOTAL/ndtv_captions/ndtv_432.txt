The Indian cricket team will be playing a second World Cup final in eight months when it takes on South Africa in Barbados in the summit clash of the ongoing T20 mega event on Saturday. India lost to Australia in the final of 2023 Cricket World Cup on November 19 despite reaching the summit clash with an unbeaten tag. Now, the side will have another chance to end its long wait for the ICC title drought when it faces the Proteas in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024.
