Abuse by students and reluctance on the part of teachers to take action compelled her to drop out of school after class IX, says Maya Thakur, the transgender icon of Himachal Pradesh State Election Commission. Hailing from the Kothi village in Kunihar area of the Solan district under Shimla parliamentary constituency, Ms Thakur said that the situation had become so grim that villagers started pressuring her family to "throw her out".

She was perhaps the only transgender among 35 belonging to the third gender in the state, who gathered the courage to speak up.
