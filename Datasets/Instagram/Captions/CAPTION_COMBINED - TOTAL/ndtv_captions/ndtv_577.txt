When Md Ali Hussain bade his family goodbye before leaving for Kuwait 18 days ago, little did they know it would be the last time they would ever see him. A pall of gloom descended at the residence of Hussain in Ranchi's Hindpiri locality, as his family members woke up to the news of his demise in a deadly fire in the West Asian country.

The youngest among three siblings, 24-year-old Hussain went to Kuwait from Ranchi to support his family, his father Mubarak Hussain (57) said.
