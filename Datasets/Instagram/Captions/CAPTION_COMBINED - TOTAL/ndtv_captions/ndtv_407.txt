In a recent incident that garnered significant attention, Amisha Aggarwal, a software engineer at Google, experienced a harrowing accident while riding a taxi bike. Posting on 'X', Ms Aggarwal shared photos of her bruised legs from the fall, along with a firm statement: "Never taking a Rapido bike again :)" She then detailed the unnerving sequence of events.

Amisha shared that Rapido's customer care advised her to file an Insurance claim. "I don't have anything against Rapido, but the bike riders usually drive very recklessly, and I'd advise everyone to avoid booking two-wheelers if they love their life," she concluded.
