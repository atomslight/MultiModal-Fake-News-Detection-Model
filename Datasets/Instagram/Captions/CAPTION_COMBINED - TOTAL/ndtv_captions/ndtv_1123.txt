A woman from Maryland is celebrating a $50,000 (Rs 41,66977) Powerball win after her boyfriend convinced her to buy a lottery ticket. The lucky winner, nicknamed "Olney Winner" after her Maryland locality, purchased a $10 quick-pick ticket at Weis Markets in Laurel before the April 20th drawing. The ticket remained forgotten in her purse until Monday, when she discovered it and scanned it using the Maryland Lottery app.
