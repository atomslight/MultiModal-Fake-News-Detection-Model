PM Modi interacted with the T20 World Cup-winning Indian team on Thursday in New Delhi. Star batter Virat Kohli, who was named 'Player of the Match' for his 76-run knock, opened up on his form in the tournament. Kohli scored just 75 before the final, but fired when it mattered the most, helping India lift the title in Barbados. Kohli revealed how head coach Rahul Dravid showed faith in him, especially when his confidence hit rock bottom.
