To encourage punctuality and improve productivity, Kaushal Shah, the founder of Evor Beauty in Mumbai, implemented a new policy requiring employees to arrive at the office by 9:30 am. A fine of ₹ 200 was imposed on those who arrived late. However, this policy had an unexpected outcome when Shah himself accumulated ₹ 1,000 in fines for being late.
