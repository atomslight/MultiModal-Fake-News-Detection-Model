PM Modi thanks people who added 'Modi Ka Parivar' to their social media display names during #LokSabhaElections2024 campaign; requests them to remove it now.

In a post on X, the PM says, "The display name may change, but our bond as one Parivar striving for India's progress remains strong and unbroken."
