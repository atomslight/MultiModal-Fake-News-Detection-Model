The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it has decided to cancel the scorecards of 1,563 NEET-UG 2024 candidates who were given grace marks. This decision comes in response to allegations of unfair means during the examination process.

In a statement to the court on Thursday, the Centre announced that these 1,563 students will be provided with the option to take a re-test. This move aims to ensure fairness and integrity in the examination process.
