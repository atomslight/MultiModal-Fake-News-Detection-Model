#NDTVWorld | In war-torn Sudan, women are being forced to have sex with soldiers to get food to feed their families, a report said. Over two dozen women who fled the Sudanese city of Omdurman said that having sex with soldiers was the only way they could access food or goods that they could sell to raise money to feed their families.
