Cyclists had a 47 per cent reduced risk of early death and a 10 per cent lower risk of hospitalization for any reason than commuters who drive or take the train, a new study has revealed.

The research, published in BMJ Public Health by UK researchers, said, "This study strengthens the evidence that active commuting has population-level health benefits and can contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality."
