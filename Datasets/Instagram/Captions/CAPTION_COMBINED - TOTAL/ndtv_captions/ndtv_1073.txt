This Sita and Gita were not twins, but the past year of their lives could have made for an interesting movie nonetheless. Missing and suspected to have been murdered, the sisters in their 20s from Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur have turned up not only alive but married with a child each.

The two sisters, along with their brother and parents, used to live in Delhi, while their hometown was UP's Gorakhpur. In January 2023, their brother, Ajay Prajapati, filed a missing report for his sisters Sita (20) and Gita (21).
