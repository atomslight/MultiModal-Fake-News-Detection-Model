Actor Jackie Shroff today approached the Delhi High Court against the unlicensed use of his name and personality attributes by several entities for commercial gain. Counsel appearing for the actor objected to the "misuse" of his personality and publicity rights through sale of merchandise, ringtones, wallpapers as well as "insulting" memes and GIFs and the use of artificial intelligence.
