The 17-year-old boy at the wheel of the speeding Porsche that hit a bike in Pune Saturday night, killing a man and a woman, was out on bail 15 hours after he was arrested. His lawyer Prashant Patil said a court granted bail to the minor on conditions -- he has to work with traffic police in Yerwada for 15 days, write an essay on accidents, undergo treatment for his drinking habit and take counselling sessions. The accused is the son of a prominent Pune realtor.
