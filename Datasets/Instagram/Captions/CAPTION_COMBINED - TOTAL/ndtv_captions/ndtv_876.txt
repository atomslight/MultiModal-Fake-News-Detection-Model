'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma' actor Gurucharan Singh, who had been missing for over 25 days, returned home on Friday, police said. The 50-year-old actor's family had filed a missing complaint after he left his home in Delhi on April 22 but never reached Mumbai.

Mr Singh, who played the role of Roshan Singh Sodhi in the popular TV show, was interrogated after he returned home. He told the police that he "had left worldly life" to begin a "religious journey".
