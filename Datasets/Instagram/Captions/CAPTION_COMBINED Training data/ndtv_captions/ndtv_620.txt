A pregnant woman went into labour while attending Taylor Swift's concert in Australia. The 31-year-old danced through the pain and gave birth days later, as per a report in the New York Post. Jenn Gutierrez, who was 38 weeks pregnant, flew 412 kilometres from Canberra, Australia, to Melbourne to witness her favourite singer perform. Despite the fact that her due date was just two weeks away, she was determined to attend the Eras Tour with her husband, Michael Sin and her twin sister.
