Bengaluru is infamous for its traffic and hours-long traffic jams. People on social media keep sharing about the traffic nightmare and low availability of public transport. Due to this, many people in the city take private cabs and are dependent on cab aggregators like Ola and Uber. Recently, a woman in Bengaluru shared how her Uber bills exceeded half of her monthly rent.
