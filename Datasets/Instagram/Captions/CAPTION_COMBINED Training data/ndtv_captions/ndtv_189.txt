In the event of a Madhya Pradesh police jawan dying in the line of duty, the â‚¹ 1 crore ex gratia given by the government will be distributed equally between the deceased's wife and parents, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav has announced.

The decision assumes significance as it comes in the backdrop of the parents of Captain Anshuman Singh demanding from the Centre a revision in next of kin (NOK) rules after the late officer's wife reportedly left their home following her husband's death.
