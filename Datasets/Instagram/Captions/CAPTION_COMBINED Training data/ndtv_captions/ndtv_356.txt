Did you know that an insect can cost as much â‚¹75 lakh? The 'stag beetle' is one of the most expensive insects in the world. So, what makes it so special? A stag beetle is expensive because it is quite rare and believed to be a lucky charm. Some think that keeping a stag beetle can make you rich overnight.

These insects represent a "significant saproxylic assemblage in forest ecosystems and are noted for their enlarged mandibles and male polymorphism," read a recent study in the Scientific Data journal.
