#NDTVPollOfPolls | The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win as many as seven Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu - a state in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has struggled in recent centre and state elections - exit polls said Saturday evening, after voting finished for the seventh and final phase.

The most optimistic prediction for the BJP's coalition comes from India TV-CNX - which gives it between five and seven seats. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicts two to four seats.

A health warning: Exit polls often get it wrong.
