Deep within Earth lies a solid metal ball that rotates independently of our spinning planet, like a top whirling inside a larger top, enveloped in mystery. Since its discovery by Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann in 1936, this inner core has fascinated researchers. Its movement - including rotation speed and direction - has been the subject of a decades-long debate. Increasing evidence suggests that the core's spin has changed significantly in recent years, but scientists remain divided on what exactly is happening and what it signifies.
