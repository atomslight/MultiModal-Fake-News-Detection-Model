When a civil service aspirant right-swiped on a dating app, he had no idea he was walking into a sinister plot carefully planned to scam men looking for love. On Sunday, the victim, not named by the police, reached the Black Mirror Cafe in East Delhi's Vikas Marg area to celebrate the birthday of Versha, a woman he had recently matched with on "Tinder".

The "date" was going quite well until Versha had to rush out due to a family emergency. As the man finished the food and called for the check, the bill stunned him - he owed the cafe an obscene â‚¹ 1,21,917.70 for food that should not cost more than a few thousand.
