Author-philanthropist and Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murty recently shared a video on X (formerly Twitter), explaining her view on gender equality. She likened men and women to "two wheels of a bicycle," emphasizing their equal but complementary roles.

In the video, Mr Murty explained that women are "wired" differently than men. She said that women are "normally very good at languages". According to her, they are excellent managers, compassionate and giving. Men, on the other hand, are "different," Ms Murty said. "They are wired differently. Their emotional quotient is not like women.. They may have a good IQ (intelligence quotient) but they definitely don't have a good EQ (emotional quotient)," she said.
