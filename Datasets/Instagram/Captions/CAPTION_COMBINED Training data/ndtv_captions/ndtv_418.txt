India skipper Rohit Sharma callled time on his T20I career after guiding the team to its second World Cup in the format, describing it as the perfect time to "say goodbye". Rohit made the announcement at the press conference after his long-time teammate Virat Kohli brought down curtains on his fabled career minutes after India defeated South Africa by seven runs at the Kensington Oval, Barbados in the final.

"I didn't think that I would retire from T20Is, but the situation was such... I thought it was the perfect situation for me. Nothing better than winning the cup and saying goodbye," Rohit said in a video.
