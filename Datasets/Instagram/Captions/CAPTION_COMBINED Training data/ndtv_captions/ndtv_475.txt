The Supreme Court on Monday refused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal immediate relief in his battle to overturn the High Court's interim stay on a bail order issued last week by a lower court. The court responded to Mr Kejriwal's arguments - that the High Court erred in staying bail without fully reading the order, and rationale, of the lower court - by saying it would wait till the said order came on record, and the High Court had a chance to re-examine the stay - before ruling on his plea.
