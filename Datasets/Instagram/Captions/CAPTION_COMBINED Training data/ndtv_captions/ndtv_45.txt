Photos of French President Emmanuel Macron tightly embracing his Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera during the opening ceremony of Paris Olympics has gone viral on social media. Ms Oudea-Castera, 46, is also seen planting a kiss close to Mr Macron's neck, also 46 years old, reported The Telegraph.

Gabriel Attal, France's Prime Minister, can be seen looking the other way as Ms Oudea-Castera embraced the French president. The photos have caused a stir in France, with users comparing the affectionate display to a lover's embrace. "Gabriel Attal, he pretends to look elsewhere! He doesn't know where to stand," commented one user.
