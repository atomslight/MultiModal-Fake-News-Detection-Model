In a brazen attack, the Tamil Nadu chief of the Bahujan Samaj Party was hacked to death by six bike-borne men near his house in Chennai on Friday. The 6 men attacked Armstrong when he was having a discussion with a few party functionaries near his house in the city's Sembium area and then fled. The family rushed him to a hospital, but he was declared brought dead.
