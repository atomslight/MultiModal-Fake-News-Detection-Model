A 26-year-old Instagram influencer died after falling into a gorge at Kumbhe waterfall near Maharashtra's Raigad. Aanvi Kamdar, a resident of Mumbai, fell into a 300-foot gorge while shooting a reel, authorities said. Aanvi had embarked on a trip with seven friends to the waterfall on July 16. The outing took a tragic turn around 10.30 am when Aanvi slipped into a deep crevice when they were shooting a video.

After a six-hour rescue operation, Aanvi was safely brought out from the gorge. However, due to severe injuries sustained in the fall, she died at the Managaon sub-district hospital soon after she was brought in.
