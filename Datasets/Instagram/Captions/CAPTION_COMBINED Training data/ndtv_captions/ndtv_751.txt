A 40-year-old man from Bihar's Darbhanga died at Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia hospital yesterday after he suffered a heatstroke during the record-breaking heatwave in the national capital.

The man was admitted to the hospital late Monday night. A doctor who attended to him said he was living in a room with no cooler or fan and had high fever. The body temperature, the doctor said, crossed the 107 degrees Fahrenheit mark -- nearly 10 degrees above normal.
