The fact that the teenager who rammed his father's Porsche into two techies in Pune in May, killing them on the spot, was given bail and asked to write a 300-word essay on road safety had sparked national outrage.

NDTV has now accessed the essay, in which the 17-year-old explains why he left the spot after the accident and stresses the need to follow traffic rules.
