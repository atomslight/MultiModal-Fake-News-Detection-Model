#NDTVWorld | Loneliness affects everyone at different times. Although it is well-documented that men are less likely than women to talk about feelings and to seek help, our research found men's work arrangements can be a significant contributor.

We found loneliness was highest among men in their late 40s but it also occurred at other times, often shaped by how they perceived their careers and income.
