Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, the poster girl for women aspiring to fly into space, was set to reach for the skies again today in a brand-new spacecraft, but it did not happen as planned.

The launch into space on the Boeing Starliner was "scrubbed" or called off just three minutes and fifty-one seconds before lift-off.
