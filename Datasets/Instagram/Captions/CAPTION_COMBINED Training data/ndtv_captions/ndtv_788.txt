Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal caused a stir with a social media post about the Cannes Film Festival. Known for his candid remarks, Mr Mittal commented on the event's accessibility, implying it's become open to everyone.

On his X account (formerly Twitter), Mr Mittal hinted that Cannes was once exclusive, "There was a time only A-listers could Cannes, but these days anybody Canne."
