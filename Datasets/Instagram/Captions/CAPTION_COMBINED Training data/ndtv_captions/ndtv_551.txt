In what appeared like scenes from a heist film, twenty masked men stormed into a Pune-headquartered jewellery store in the US and emptied it. CCTV cameras at PNG Jewellers' store in California's Sunnyvale show the robbers, all of them masked and some in hoodies, rushing inside the store after breaking down the glass doors. The footage of the smash-and-grab robbery has been shared widely on social media.
