#DelhiNCR | In a heartbreaking incident that yet again raises questions over civic negligence endangering Delhi residents' lives, a 23-year-old woman and her three-year-old son died after falling in a drain during the downpour in the national capital last evening.

Tanuja Bisht had gone to the weekly market in Ghazipur with her three-year-old Priyansh and was on her way back when it started raining. The road was waterlogged, and Tanuja fell into an open drain with her son. Hours later, the two bodies were recovered about 500 m away, the mother still clutching her son's hand.
