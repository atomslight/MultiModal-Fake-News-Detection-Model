Two days after a video gaming zone in Rajkot burst into flames and killed 28 people, including nine children, and left their bodies burnt beyond recognition, the city's municipal body came under fire from the Gujarat High Court for failing to certify at least two such structures in the city.

The court was furious when told two gaming zones had been operating - for over 24 months each - without the required permits, including fire safety certificates, and said it could no longer "trust" the state government, which is controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party.
