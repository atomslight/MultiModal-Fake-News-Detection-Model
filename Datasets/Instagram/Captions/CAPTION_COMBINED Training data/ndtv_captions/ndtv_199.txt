The Supreme Court on Thursday heard a clutch of petitions seeking re-test or cancellation of the 2024 NEET-UG - for entrance to undergraduate medical courses - and raised concerns over the stand of the Centre and the National Testing Agency (NTA) -- the body that conducts the nationwide exam -- that the paper leak happened only about 45 minutes before the start of the exam in certain centres.

A bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud wondered if all the 180 questions could have been solved within 45 minutes, given that the examination started at 10.15 AM, to which Mr Mehta replied that there were seven persons in the gang who divided the questions among themselves.
