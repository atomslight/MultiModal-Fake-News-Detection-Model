Trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar, who is in the eye of a storm over alleged misuse of power and claims that she made in her UPSC candidature, has landed in more trouble with the central government launching a probe against her.

Ms Khedkar had courted controversy over using a siren on her private Audi and raising demands for a separate house and car - privileges not available to junior officers. But the 2023-batch IAS officer now faces far more serious charges that raise questions about her selection process in the civil services.
