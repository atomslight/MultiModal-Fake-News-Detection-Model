A woman in Uttar Pradesh's Noida has alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a man in the Sector 48 area of the city. The woman alleged that when she went outside her house to shoot a video in the rain, a stranger walked up to her and ripped her shorts. Right when he was assaulting her, two girls came to her rescue and the suspect had to run away.

Seeking justice, the woman headed to the Sector 49 police station to file a complaint. However, she alleges that the officers on duty refused to register an FIR and instead questioned her decision to be out in the rain at that time.
