#NDTVWorld | Former US president Donald Trump railed against his criminal conviction on Friday, calling his New York trial "very unfair", attacking the process as politicised and vowing to appeal.

"It was very unfair... You saw what happened to some of the witnesses that were on our side -- they were literally crucified," Trump said in a rambling speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan in which he called his adversaries "sick" and "fascists."
