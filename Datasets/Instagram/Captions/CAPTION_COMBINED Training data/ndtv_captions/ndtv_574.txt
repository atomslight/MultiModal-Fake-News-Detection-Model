Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar has said that the ruling party fell short of a majority as a feeling of arrogance had taken over and the INDIA bloc ended at Number 2 position for being anti-Ram. Speaking at the 'Ramrath Ayodhya Yatra Darshan Poojan Samaroh' event in Kanota near Jaipur on Thursday, he said, "The party which did bhakti of Lord Ram and became arrogant was stopped at 240, however, it became the biggest party."
