Above-normal rainfall is expected this monsoon season across the country in a much-needed respite from the heatwave sweeping the country, the Indian Meteorological Department said.

"The South West Monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106% of the long-period average with a model error of 4%. Thus, above-normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole," the weather office said.
