A social media streamer named Natalie Reynolds is in trouble for telling a stranger to jump into a lake in Texas, even though the woman said she couldn't swim. Reynolds was filming a live stream when she offered the woman $20 to jump in the lake. The woman jumped in, but then started to struggle and yell for help. Instead of helping, Reynolds left the scene.
