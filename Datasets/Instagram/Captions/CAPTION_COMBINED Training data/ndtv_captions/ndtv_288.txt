In recent months, a lot has been discussed about working hours, the environment and a healthy work culture which ensures people have appropriate time to be with family and friends. Now, an old video of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon discussing work-life balance has gone viral on social media. In the video, Mr Dimon said that the individual must carve out time for their personal lives rather than blame the office.
