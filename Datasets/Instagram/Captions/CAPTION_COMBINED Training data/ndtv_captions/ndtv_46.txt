A Gurugram-based software engineer turned the tables on a cyber scammer who had attempted to trick him into updating his PAN details through a fraudulent link on behalf of the HDFC bank. Instead of falling victim to the scam, Mr Gaurav Sharan, a cybersecurity analyst, responded to the scammer with an offer to redesign the scammer's fake website for â‚¹ 20,000.

Mr Sharan shared screenshots of this conversation on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), with the caption: "Lesson: Never mess with a developer."
