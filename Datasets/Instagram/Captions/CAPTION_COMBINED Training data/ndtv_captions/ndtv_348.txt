In a bizarre Facebook advertisement, a landlord in Sydney has put up an enclosed balcony with a bed for rent at $969 (Rs 81,003) a month. The Facebook Marketplace listing describes the balcony in Haymarket in Sydney's inner suburbs as a ''sunny room'' that is fit to accommodate one person. Images of the balcony, which have gone viral on other social media websites as well, show the room decked out with a single bed, a mirror, blinds, and a rug over tiled flooring.
