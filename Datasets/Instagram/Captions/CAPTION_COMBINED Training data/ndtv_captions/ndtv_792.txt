The residents of Tapu Majri village in Haryana's Yamunanagar district stayed away from casting their votes in the general election on Saturday, saying their demand for the construction of a bridge over the Yamuna river has been pending for long. The villagers recently held a panchayat and threatened to boycott the Lok Sabha election if the state government failed to take steps to fulfil their demand.

The village has around 550 voters and only two votes were cast, officials said.
