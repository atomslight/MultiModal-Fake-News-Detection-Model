Food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy have once again hiked platform fees to ₹ 6 per order from an earlier ₹ 5 - a 20 per cent increase.

Currently being charged in Delhi and Bengaluru, the platform fee is different from delivery fee, goods and services tax (GST), restaurant charges, and handling charges.
