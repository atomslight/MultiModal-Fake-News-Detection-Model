The family of Agniveer Ajay Kumar has demanded the 'hero' status for him from the Indian Army after he died in the line of duty. The family said that the compensation money cannot replace Ajay Kumar.

"We want the Agniveer scheme to be scrapped and we should get pension and canteen card," his father told NDTV.
