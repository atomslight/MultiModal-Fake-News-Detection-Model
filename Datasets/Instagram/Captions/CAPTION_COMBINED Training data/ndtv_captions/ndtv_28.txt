Leader of Opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi claimed that the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was planning a raid on him following his 'Chakravyuh' speech in the Parliament on July 29.

The Congress MP said that he was 'waiting with open arms' after ED 'insiders' told him that a raid was being planned.
