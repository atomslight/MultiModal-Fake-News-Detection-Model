John Cena, a 16-time WWE Champion, has announced his retirement from in-ring competitions with effect from 2025. Mr Cena announced his retirement during a surprise appearance at the 'Money in the Bank' event in Toronto today. The WWE legend, 47, hit the ring carrying a towel with a slightly altered version of his most famous catchphrase, "My Time Is Now", this time reading, "The Last Time Is Now."

His shirt simply read, "John Cena Farewell Tour." When Mr Cena began to speak, the Toronto crowd erupted with chants of "No! No! No!".
