A 27-year-old woman, working at a bank in Uttar Pradesh, died by suicide at her home, allegedly after suffering six months of intense bullying, body-shaming and mental torture at her work place. Shivani Tyagi was a relationship manager at a Noida-based branch of Axis Bank. She allegedly died by suicide at her Ghaziabad home last Friday.

"It appears that she was being body-shamed, bullied and harassed at her workplace," said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ghaziabad, Gyananjay Singh.
