AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal on Sunday said that she has been receiving rape and death threats after a "character assassination" campaign allegedly orchestrated by party leaders and volunteers.

She said that the situation escalated after the YouTuber Dhruv Rathee posted a one-sided video against her.
