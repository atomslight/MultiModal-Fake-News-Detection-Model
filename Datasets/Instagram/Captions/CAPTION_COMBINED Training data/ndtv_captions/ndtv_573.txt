Several residents of a housing complex built by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) under a Gujarat government scheme have been staging protests against the allotment of an apartment to a Muslim woman, saying the locality is meant for Hindus only.

Demanding that the allotted flat be cancelled, the residents warned of intensifying their agitation and taking up the matter with the state and the Centre.
