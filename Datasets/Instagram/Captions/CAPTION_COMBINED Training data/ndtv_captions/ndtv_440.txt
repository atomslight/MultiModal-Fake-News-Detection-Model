#Opinion | "If Indian food were to be defined by a single curry, something often referred to as a 'mother sauce' in Western culinary jargon, it would be the good ol' red curry made with onions, tomatoes, ginger and garlic. The sauce becomes pav bhaaji with the addition of vegetables, but it also doubles up as kadhai chicken, shahi paneer, and butter chicken, depending on what you add to it. They all are, at the core, just the same.

But Indian food was never this monotonous historically. It still isn't. Only, it's the on-the-go, "scammy" type cooking that has made this onion-tomato-ginger-garlic concoction the mainstay of most 'dishes'."
