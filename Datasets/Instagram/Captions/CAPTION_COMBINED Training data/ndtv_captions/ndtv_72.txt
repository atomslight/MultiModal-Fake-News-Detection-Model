Israel attacked Hezbollah targets and threatened further retaliation for a rocket strike that resulted in the death of 12. But Israel has also signaled openness to a proposed Gaza truce that could also calm the combustible front with Lebanon. In the worst single-incident of civilian losses for Israel since Hamas stormed into its southern villages and army bases on October 7, a rocket exploded in Golan Heights on Saturday, killing 12.

The rocket strike hit a football pitch and killed children who local authorities said were aged 10 to 16.
