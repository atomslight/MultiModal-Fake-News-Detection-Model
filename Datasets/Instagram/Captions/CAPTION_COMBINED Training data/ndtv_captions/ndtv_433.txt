An extraordinary story unfolded when Rajkumari, a resident of Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur, stumbled upon a familiar face while scrolling through Instagram reels. Rajkumari was struck by a young man in a reel who had a distinctive broken tooth - a feature she remembered vividly from her brother Bal Govind.

Govind had disappeared 18 years ago after leaving their home in Inayatpur village in Fatehpur, to seek work in Mumbai. Despite initial contact with his friends, Govind eventually lost touch with everyone and never returned home.
