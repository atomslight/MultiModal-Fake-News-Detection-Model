After 80 years, the famed World War II U.S. Navy submarine USS Harder's wreck was discovered in the South China Sea. Located off the northern Philippine island of Luzon at 3,000 feet (about 900 meters), the submarine rests mostly intact except for damage from a Japanese depth charge behind its conning tower.
