A speeding BMW hit a couple on a two-wheeler in Mumbai's Worli this morning, resulting in the death of a woman, police said. At 5:30 am, Kaveri Nakva and her husband Pradik Nakva, from the Koliwada area of Worli, made a trip to Sassoon Dock to fetch fish. As they were returning home with their catch, their two-wheeler was struck from behind by a speeding BMW.

The impact was severe, causing their bike to overturn and throwing both the husband and wife onto the bonnet of the car. In a desperate attempt to save himself, the husband managed to jump off the bonnet. However, his wife was not as fortunate as she was dragged for 100 metres by the car attempting to flee the scene.
