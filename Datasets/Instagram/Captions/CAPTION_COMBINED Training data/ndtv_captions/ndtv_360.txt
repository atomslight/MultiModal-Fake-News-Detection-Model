Two soldiers were killed in action today in separate encounters with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district. Four terrorists were subsequently gunned down by the forces, while four others are believed to be hiding. The back-to-back encounters began after security forces launched anti-terrorist operations based on specific information about the presence of terrorists at two separate places in the district.
