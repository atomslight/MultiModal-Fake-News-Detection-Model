Donald Trump questioned Wednesday whether Democrat Kamala Harris is really Black or is using race as a political convenience in an interview that sent shockwaves through the 2024 presidential contest. "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black," Trump told a panel of interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago.

"And now she wants to be known as Black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?" he said of Harris, who is the first Black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history.
