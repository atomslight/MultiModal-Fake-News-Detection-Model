A new paper by researchers at Harvard University's Human Flourishing Program posits that ''unidentified anomalous phenomena'' (UAP), more commonly referred to as UFOs and extraterrestrial beings, could be living underground, on the moon or even walking among humans. The research also explores the idea that UFOs, or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) could be spaceships visiting Earth-based alien friends.
