In September 2004, an extraordinary incident unfolded in Bavaria, Germany. A 23-man Sri Lankan handball team had arrived in the country to take part in a sports exchange programme consisting of friendly matches against local clubs, according to Deutsche Welle. However, the team's performance during a match raised eyebrows. Players seemed to show unfamiliarity with the rules of the sport, and their performance was described as "awful" by the opposing team.
