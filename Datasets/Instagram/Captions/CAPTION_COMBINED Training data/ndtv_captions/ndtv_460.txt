#NDTVWorld | A six-foot-tall wax statue of former US President Abraham Lincoln in Washington melted as the capital city's temperatures soared over the weekend.

The temperatures, which reportedly touched 37 degrees Celsius, disfigured the wax structure at the site of Camp Barker, a Civil War-era refugee camp that housed formerly enslaved and freed African Americans.
