To combat the heat, a man from Rajasthan's Jodhpur devised an unusual tool. He put up a makeshift shower on his motorcycle to stay cool while riding in broad daylight. In the clip, the man is seen riding the scooter while enjoying the water shower from a plastic dispenser kept on the floorboard. Social media users have been amused by the video of the man's creative mini-shower, which has gone viral on the internet.
