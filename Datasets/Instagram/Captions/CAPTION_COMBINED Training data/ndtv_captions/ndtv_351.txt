Spain has come up with a new mobile application that will not only require users to verify their age, but also limits the number of credits for viewing adult content.

The mobile application, officially called the Digital Wallet Beta (Cartera Digital Beta), and locally known as the "pajaporte", will allow platforms to check whether the user is above the age of 18 years or not. To verify their age, the viewers will be asked to use the mobile app. The application will work as a mobile phone wallet and will verify users' age through one of the five government-issued IDs.
