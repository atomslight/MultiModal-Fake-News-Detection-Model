Sharks off the coast of Brazil have cocaine in them and scientists believe the drug may be altering their behaviour. In a study conducted on 13 Brazilian sharpnose sharks from waters near Rio de Janeiro, marine biologists found high levels of cocaine in their muscles and livers. While it is not known how the sharks have been feeding on the drug, some theories exist. Scientists believe that the cocaine likely came from the drainage of illegal labs that produce drugs or from the excrement of drug users through untreated sewage.
