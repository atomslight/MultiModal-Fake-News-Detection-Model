It is a woman's decision whether to continue the pregnancy or go ahead with medical termination, the Allahabad High Court observed while hearing a 15-year-old rape victim's plea for abortion at 32 weeks.

The court also said even if she decides to go ahead with the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption, the duty lies on the State to ensure that it is carried out as privately as possible.
