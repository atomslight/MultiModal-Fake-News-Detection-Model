Earth Sciences Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday said that the weather station in Delhi that recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius in Delhi - the highest ever in India - had suffered a sensor error.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) investigated the temperature sensor in northwest Delhi's Mungeshpur after the unusually high reading at the peak of a severe heatwave.
