In his desperate quest to leave the country for the United States, a 24-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow went to great lengths, including transforming his appearance to resemble a 67-year-old.

On the evening of June 18, around 5:20 pm, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) stationed at Delhi Airport's Terminal 3 intercepted a suspicious couple. Guru Sewak Singh, accompanied by his wife, approached the immigration counter with forged documents and an appearance designed to deceive. The passport in his possession identified him as Rashwinder Singh Sahota, allegedly born on February 2, 1957 in Punjab's Jalandhar and bound for Canada on Air Canada flight AC 043. The passport bore the number 438851 and listed Rashwinder's age as 67.

However, discrepancies between Guru Sewak's physical appearance and the details in the passport immediately raised red flags.
