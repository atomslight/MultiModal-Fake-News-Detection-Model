The Union Public Service Commission has issued a notice to cancel selection of trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar, who was being investigated for lying about visual and mental disabilities and faking her identity (including changing the names of her parents) to clear the Civil Services entrance exam. A notification issued Friday afternoon said Ms Khedkar "fraudulently availed attempts beyond the permissible limit", and the UPSC had "initiated a series of actions against" the 23-year-old.
