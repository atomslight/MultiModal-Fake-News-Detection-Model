Archaeologists in Jerusalem have discovered a 2,300-year-old gold ring believed to have belonged to a child living in the city's Hellenistic period. The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) said in a statement that the ring, set with a red gem, was "exceedingly well-preserved" with no signs of rust or weathering.

It was unearthed recently at the City of David archaeological site by Tehiya Gangate, a member of the excavation team.
