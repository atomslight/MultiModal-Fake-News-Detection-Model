Sildenafil, popularly known by its brand name Viagra, may have benefits beyond treating men suffering from erectile dysfunction, a new study has found. The drug has the ability to enhance blood flow to the brain and improve the function of blood vessels in individuals at high risk of vascular dementia, says the research carried out by scientists at the University of Oxford.

Vascular dementia is a condition that majorly impacts cognitive functions, including judgement, memory and others. This happens due to the reduced blood supply to the brain affecting brain tissue and damaging it.
