In Uttar Pradesh's Pratapgarh, police found a unique solution to settle a buffalo ownership dispute. After failed mediation attempts, they left the buffalo unattended on the road, deciding that it would follow its rightful owner. The buffalo subsequently walked back to Nandlal Saroj's home in Rai Askaranpur village, resolving the issue definitively.
