It was just another Sunday morning for Kaveri Nakhava and her husband Pradeep Nakhava. The couple, who lived in Worli's Koliwada and sold fish for a living, set out on their scooter and reached Sassoon Dock to buy fish they could sell later. They were on their back when a speeding BMW crashed into the two-wheeler, throwing Pradik and Kaveri into the air. Pradeep fell on the ground, but Kaveri was dragged by the car. She was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late.

Rajesh Shah, the deputy leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and his driver, Rajshree Bijawat, have been taken in police custody and are being question. Mihir Shah is on the run and four police teams are looking for him.
