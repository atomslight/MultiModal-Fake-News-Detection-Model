Amid the furore over the alleged NEET paper leak, a police investigation has revealed an extensive conspiracy in another exam. The UP Review Officer/Assistant Review Officer exam, held on Feb 11, was cancelled after a shocking paper leak involving over 10 lakh students.

Investigating officer Amit Srivastava, a member of the Varanasi unit of the special task force, said: "All of them were engineers, they were smart and technically very sound. They meticulously planned the paper leak."
