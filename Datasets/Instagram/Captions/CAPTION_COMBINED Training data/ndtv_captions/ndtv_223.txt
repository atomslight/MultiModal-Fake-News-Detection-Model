Pride and grief were locked in a duel as Nilima Thapa fought back tears to speak about her son, Captain Brijesh Thapa, who died in an encounter with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Doda last night. "He will never come home," Ms Thapa told news agency ANI. Describing her 27-year-old son, she said, "He was very decent. He never complained about anything. And he always wanted to join the Army. We had told him that life is tough in the Army. He had also seen his father's life, and he still wanted to join the Army."

Ms Thapa said she is a proud mother whose son has done something for the country. "But, there is also the fact that he is now very far away," she said, her eyes welling up. She said the government must and will respond to these attacks.
