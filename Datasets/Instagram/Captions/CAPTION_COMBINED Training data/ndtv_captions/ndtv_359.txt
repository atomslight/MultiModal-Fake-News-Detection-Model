Refusing to be outdone by reports of children being served chapatis and salt in their mid-day meals in other states, a school in Chhattisgarh has been giving its students plain rice with only some turmeric added to it. Vegetables are missing, as are pulses on several occasions, which would have enabled the young children to at least have some khichdi.

The state's education department has a prescribed menu for mid-day meals, promising a variety of nutritious food.

The malnutrition rate in Chhattisgarh stood at 17.76% in 2022.
