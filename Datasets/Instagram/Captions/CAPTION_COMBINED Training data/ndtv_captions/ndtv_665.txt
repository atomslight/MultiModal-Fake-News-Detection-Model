#InPics | NDA vs I.N.D.I.A.

BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) - which won 293 seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha election to push past the majority mark of 272 - will form the new government. On Tuesday the INDIA bloc defied exit pollsters to mount a real challenge to the BJP in a national election - a first since the 'Modi wave' swept it to power in 2014. The opposition alliance finished with 232 seats - 40 short of the 272-majority mark.
