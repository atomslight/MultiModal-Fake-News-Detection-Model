Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take oath for a 3rd time on Saturday, and in so doing, become the first (and only) three-term leader of the country since Congress stalwart and India's first PM, Jawaharlal Nehru. PM Modi has reached Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet President Droupadi Murmu and resign from the top post. He would then stake claim to form the government.
