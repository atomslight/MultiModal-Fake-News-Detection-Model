#NDTVPollOfPolls | A historic third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- that's what exit polls are predicting as the seventh and the last phase of the Lok Sabha election concluded this evening. None, though, have yet put the NDA across its dream score of 400 of 543 Lok Sabha seats. While the numbers vary, five exit polls are predicting that the INDIA bloc will be left far behind.

Health Warning: Exit Polls do not always get it right.

An aggregate of five exit polls indicates that the NDA will get 365 seats, and the INDIA bloc will get 142 seats.
