In a YouTube video, Gagan, a small-town boy from Atrauli, Aligarh, managed to crack IIT despite his humble background. During an interaction with Alakh Pandey, Founder and CEO of Physics Wallah (PW), he revealed that his ultimate goal was to get into IIT, one of the premier institutes in the country. For preparation, he took a year off to devote himself entirely to his studies, and it paid off. He achieved an impressive AIR 5286 in JEE Advanced 2024.

Raised in a family of six, Gagan's father worked as a godown keeper at a gas agency. Gagan and his elder brother worked alongside their father to support him, lifting gas cylinders for a daily wage of â‚¹ 350. Despite the heavy burden of these responsibilities, Gagan remained focused on his dream of getting into IIT.
