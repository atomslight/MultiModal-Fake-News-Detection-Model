Virginia Hislop has dedicated her entire life to expanding access to education. Now, at the age of 105, she has finally completed her academic journey. On Sunday, Mrs Hislop celebrated receiving a master's degree in education from Stanford University-83 years after leaving the campus just short of earning the degree. Her son-in-law contacted the university and learned that her final thesis, the last requirement she had not fulfilled, was no longer necessary.
