The mobile phone of a friend of the key accused in the Mumbai BMW hit-and-run case led the police to Mihir Shah, who had fled the scene after allegedly running over a woman with his luxury car on Sunday. It took the Mumbai Police three days to catch the accused because he, along with his mother and sisters, had switched off their mobile phones, sources said.
