Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu retaliated against his predecessor YS Jaganmohan Reddy in the state assembly today, comparing him to Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar. The attack came a day after a protest by Mr Reddy in Delhi -- an exhibition of photos and videos of the violence in the state at the India International Centre. He has alleged that Mr Naidu and his party has been targeting the workers and leaders of his YSR Congress.
