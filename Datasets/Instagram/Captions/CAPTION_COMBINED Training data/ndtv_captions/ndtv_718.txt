Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter Shiloh Jolie-Pitt has sought to drop "Pitt" from her name. On her 18th birthday on May 27, she filed a petition in the Los Angeles County Superior Court to get her name changed. Her current full name is Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt.

Shiloh is the third-eldest of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's six children.
