In yet another addition to the series of revelations in the row surrounding trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar, questions are now being raised on a disability certificate issued to her by a Pune hospital.

The disability certificate issued by Pune's Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital is dated August 24, 2022. It mentions Ms Khedkar's address as "Plot No 53, Dehu Alandi Road, Talawade, Pimpri Chinchwad" in Pune district. But at this location, there is no house, but a factory.

Interestingly, Ms Khedkar's Audi car, which has been seized after she illegally used a red-blue beacon on it, is registered in the name of this company. Also, while the government has mandated Aadhaar for getting disability certificates, Ms Khedkar's certificate mentions that the document she produced was a ration card.
