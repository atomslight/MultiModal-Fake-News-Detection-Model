A video of two Irish bloggers debunking misconceptions about Delhi Metro that foreigners may hear is going viral on Instagram.

In the clip, Isabelle Geraghty and Colin Finnerty, Irish vloggers from Vietnam, travel in the Delhi Metro and review the various facilities and stations. They also mentioned things that left them "shocked" and called the Delhi Metro one of the "smoothest, safest and cleanest metros" they've come across in any city.
