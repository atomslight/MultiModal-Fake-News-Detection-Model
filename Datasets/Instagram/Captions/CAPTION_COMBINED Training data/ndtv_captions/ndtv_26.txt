The Bombay High Court has quashed a case lodged against a 73-year-old man for allegedly sexually abusing a woman since 1987, noting that the relationship was consensual.

A division bench of Justices A S Gadkari and Neela Gokhale said the contents of the FIR "clearly indicate a consensual relationship".
