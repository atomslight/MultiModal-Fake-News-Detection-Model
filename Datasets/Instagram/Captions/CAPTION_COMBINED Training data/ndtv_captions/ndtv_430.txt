India on Saturday recorded the highest team total in women's Test cricket on day two of the one-off Test against South Africa, surpassing the previous best of 575/9 set by Australia.

Australia had posted the total in Perth this February but India achieved the new record total of 603/6d when Richa Ghosh hammered a four in the opening ball of the 109th over bowled by Annerie Dercksen.
