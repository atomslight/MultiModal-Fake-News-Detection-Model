Tesla chief Elon Musk this morning said he has postponed his planned trip to India due to "very heavy Tesla obligations", a day before his visit was expected to begin. Musk, who owns Tesla and SpaceX, was to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his two-day visit and announce investment plans for his businesses.

The world's richest man confirmed on X he has delayed his trip, but said he looks forward to visiting India later this year.
