Indian-origin astronaut Captain Sunita Williams, who loves to eat samosas in space, is ready to fly into space once again, and this time on a brand-new spacecraft, the Boeing Starliner. The liftoff is scheduled to take place from the Kennedy Space Center on May 7, 2024, at 8.34 8.04 am India time. She says she is a bit nervous but has no jitters about flying in a new spacecraft. While training at the launch pad, Ms Williams said, "When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home."
