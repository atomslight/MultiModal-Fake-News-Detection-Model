Pune officials have sealed a city bar that served alcohol to a 17-year-old boy and his friends in the early hours of Monday, after which the drunk teen drove and rammed a Porsche sports car into a bike carrying two people, both of whom were killed. The legal drinking age in the state of Maharashtra is 25, which means it was illegal to serve liquor to the boy or his friends.
