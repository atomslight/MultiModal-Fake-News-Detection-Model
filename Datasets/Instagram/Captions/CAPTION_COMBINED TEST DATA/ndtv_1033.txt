Canadian Police on Friday said they have arrested three Indians they suspect were part of the alleged hit squad that had killed Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year. Nijjar's killing had become the epicentre of a diplomatic row between India and Canada last year after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged the role of "Indian agents" in the murder. India had rejected the charge as "absurd" and "motivated".
