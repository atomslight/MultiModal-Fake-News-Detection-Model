The family of 25-year-old Ashwini Koshta said they are dismayed by the bail conditions and are ready to fight at every level to get her justice.

"We are in shock," said her uncle Jugal Kishor Koshta. "It is condemnable that he should get bail in 15 hours. He and his parents should be investigated. We will discuss the matter once Ashwini's last rites are over tomorrow," he added. Asked if there was a possibility of political pressure in the case, he said it is "quite possible and elections are on anyway".
