Columbia, the prestigious New York university at the heart of US campus protests against the war in Gaza, announced Monday that it has cancelled the main ceremony for graduating students next week. The Ivy League institution said it would "forego the university-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15" and hold a series of smaller events instead.
