#ElectionsWithNDTV | The BJP's Sambit Patra landed in a row today over a comment that hugely offended Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.

As Odisha voted for the Lok Sabha and a new assembly in the Fifth Phase of election, Mr Patra told reporters that the Lord Jagannath, the presiding deity of Puri, "is Modi's bhakt".

When the Chief Minister shot off an angry protest, Mr Patra issued a clarification, saying it was a "slip of tongue".
