Apple Vision Pro, an augmented reality (AR) device launched by the tech giant last year, was used for the first time in a live bariatric surgery. The procedure was performed by Dr Mohit Bhandari, a leading bariatric surgeon, at one of the surgical centres of Pristyn Care in New Delhi. It included a sleeve gastric bypass and a Single Anastomosis Duodenal-leal (SADI) procedure. The surgery was conducted on a 45-year-old patient, who weighed 155 kg and suffered from obstructive sleep apnea and high blood pressure. It lasted for 40 minutes.
