A 25-year-old man with a history of criminal offences has been charged with assault second-degree after he viciously attacked a 15-year-old McDonald's worker during a brawl. The beating is alleged to have occurred after a rowdy group of customers arrived at the fast food joint on April 7 and began harassing the young employees.
