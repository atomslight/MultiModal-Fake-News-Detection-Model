The gruesome murder of a Karnataka corporator's daughter has become the latest flashpoint between the Congress and the BJP. The Congress leader's daughter was stabbed seven times by a former student of the college she was attending in Hubbali. Cops suspect that he murdered her because she rejected his advances.

Neha Hiremath, 23, was a first-year student of Master of Computer Applications and Fayaz Khondunaik was earlier her classmate. According to a senior police officer, Fayaz, who stabbed her multiple times, claimed during interrogation the two had been in a relationship but she had been avoiding him of late.
