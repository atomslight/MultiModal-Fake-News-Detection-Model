Air India Express has sacked at least 25 cabin crew, a day after nearly 300 employees of the airline called in sick and switched off their phones, leading to large-scale flight disruptions. The number of job terminations are likely to increase beyond 25. The management is also likely to hold a townhall meeting with cabin crew members today.
