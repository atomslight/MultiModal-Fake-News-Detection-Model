The Congress today lost its third Lok Sabha candidate, just days before voting on the seat. Sucharita Mohanty, the party's candidate dropped out citing lack of funds.

â€œIt is clear that only a fund crunch is holding us back from a winning campaign in Puri. I regret that without party funding, it won't be possible to carry out the campaign in Puri. I, therefore, return the INC ticket for the Puri Parliamentary Constituency herewith," Ms Puri wrote in a letter to Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge.
