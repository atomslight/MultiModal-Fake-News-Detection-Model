In a significant order, the Supreme Court highlighting "fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution" said that the opinion of a pregnant minor is an "important factor" while deciding on abortion.

"The right to choose and reproductive freedom is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, where the opinion of a minor pregnant person differs from the guardian, the court must regard the view of the pregnant person as an important factor while deciding the termination of the pregnancy," it said asserting that the consent of the pregnant person in matters of reproductive choices and abortion is "paramount".
