Thrombosis Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) -- a blood clot disorder -- is a rare side effect of AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine, and the risks far outweigh the benefits of the jab, doctors said today.

This comes after reports said that AstraZeneca has for the first time accepted in court documents that its vaccine, developed in partnership with Oxford University, can raise the risk of a rare and serious blood clot.
