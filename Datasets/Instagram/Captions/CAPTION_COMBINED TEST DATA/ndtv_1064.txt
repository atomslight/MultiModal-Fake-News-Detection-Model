A British-Italian brand sells jeans with what appears to be a pee stain, for a shocking price. Their unique pair of denim, known as "Stain Stonewash Jeans" is designed by Jordanluca, the brand founded by designers Luca Marchetto and Jordan Bowen. The original jeans are priced at $811 (approximately Rs 67,000.). However, the lighter wash is sold out and has a whopping price of $608 (Rs 50,000 approximately).
