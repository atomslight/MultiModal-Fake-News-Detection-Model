A gold watch found on the body of the richest passenger on the Titanic was auctioned in England for £1.17 million ($1.46 million) on Saturday.
It was a record sum for an object linked to the notorious 1912 shipping disaster, said auctioneers Henry Aldridge & Son. A US buyer won the bidding war, smashing the auctioneer's pre-sale estimate of between £100,000 and £150,000.
