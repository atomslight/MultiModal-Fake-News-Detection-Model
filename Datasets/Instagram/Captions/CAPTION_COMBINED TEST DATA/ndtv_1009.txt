The terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch, in which a soldier of the Indian Air Force has died, has become grist to the political mill amid the massive seven-phase election across the country.

Two leaders of the Opposition, former Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tej Pratap Yadav, have drawn a parallel to the Pulwama attack of 2019 in which 40 CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) men died, and alleged that Saturday's attack was also a "stunt" to help the BJP win.
