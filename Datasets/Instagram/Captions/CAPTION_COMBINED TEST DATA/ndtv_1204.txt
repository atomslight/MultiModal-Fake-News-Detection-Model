An attempt to create a viral Instagram reel turned fatal for a young man in Uttar Pradesh. Twenty-one-year-old Shivam Kumar hung upside down from a flag post on the roof of a school as his friends recorded the stunt. He wanted to raise a flag on the pole while hanging upside down, however, the cemented pole failed to bear the weight and collapsed leading to his death.
