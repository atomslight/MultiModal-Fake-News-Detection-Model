A four-year-old Australian boy's birthday cake with a Hamas theme that showed an operative surrounded by Palestinian flags has angered many on the internet. The cake was designed by a bakery in Sydney, which proudly shared photos of it on social media. Since the outcry, they have deleted their social media accounts.
