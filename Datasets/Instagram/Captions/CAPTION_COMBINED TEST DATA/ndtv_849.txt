The Turkish Bayraktar Akinci drone reportedly found the wreckage of the chopper Ebrahim Raisi in north Iran, close to its border with Azerbaijan.

The AKINCI01 - the call sign of the drone, detected heat signatures when it hovered over the crash site early this morning. The drone was first seen near Makaou Iran, and was last spotted near Van in Turkey, where it drew a crescent through its flight route, which was detected on its flight path by open-source flight tracking websites.
