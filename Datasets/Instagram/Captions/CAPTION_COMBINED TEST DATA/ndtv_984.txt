The Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals IPL 2024 match saw a controversial moment surrounding the dismissal of Sanju Samson. The Rajasthan Royals batter was on 86, and leading RR's 222-run chase in fine fashion vs DC, when he was caught by Shai Hope off Mukesh Kumar. It was a tight catch as Hope was almost on the boundary line.

The third umpire gave it an out but Sanju Samson refused to leave. He kept talking with the on-field umpires, even as DC owner Parth Jindal kept shouting 'Out hain'.

Reluctantly, as Samson was walking back, the RR dugout suggested that he might review that decision. However, it was not to be as he walked off.
