Lucknow Super Giants skipper KL Rahul broke his silence on the chatter surrounding strike rate in T20 cricket during the IPL 2024 match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday. Both KL Rahul and Virat Kohli has faced a lot of criticism regarding their strike rates in this year's competition despite being among the Top 5 run-scorers in IPL 2024. Rahul also found himself out of the India squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024 with skipper Rohit Sharma and chief selector Ajit Agarkar saying that they were looking for middle-order batting options while choosing wicket-keepers and that is the reason why they went with Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson.
