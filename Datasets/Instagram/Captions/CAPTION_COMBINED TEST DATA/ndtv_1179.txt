In a shocking incident, a family of eight left a UK restaurant without paying a bill worth 329 pounds or â‚¹ 34,000 approximately. In a detailed post, alongside a picture of the family, the restaurant informed that one of the women from the group tried to pay the bill using her card, however, it got declined twice. She told the staff members that her son would wait at the restaurant while she would get another card. Within a few minutes, her son received a call and left the restaurant.
