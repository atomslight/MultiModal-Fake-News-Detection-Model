#UttarPradesh | While the country speaks of women's rights, there is a political party that claims to fight for men's rights. The party is called Mera Adhikar Rashtriya Dal (MARD) and was formed in 2009 by a group of men facing legal issues related to the Dowry Prohibition Act and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.

Since its inception, the party has contested 7 elections.
