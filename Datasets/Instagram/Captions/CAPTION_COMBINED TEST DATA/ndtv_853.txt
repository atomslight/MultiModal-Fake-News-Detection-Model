To tackle the increasing number of cases of skin cancer in the Netherlands, the Dutch government decided to offer free sun protection to its citizens in 2023. Now, a video of free sunscreen vending machines in a public park is going viral on social media. In the clip, the machine can be seen stocked with Nivea sunscreen and people are seen taking turns to apply it on themselves.
