Taking a firm stand on the issue of misleading advertisements, the Supreme Court has said that celebrities and social media influencers are equally liable if the commercial for the product or service featuring them is found to be deceptive. The bench emphasised that ministries need to set up procedures to encourage the consumer to lodge a complaint and then it is taken to its logical conclusion instead of "simply being endorsed or marked".
