Wedding is a special occasion and some couples go the extra mile to celebrate it. One such couple from Tamil Nadu gave their wedding invite an IPL twist by using the colours of Chennai Super Kings (CSK). The unique wedding invite has gone viral, and features the names of the bride and groom inside the iconic CSK logo. The invite is presented in the form of an IPL ticket. The language used is also inspired by a cricket match with the use of words like "Match Preview" and "Match prediction".
