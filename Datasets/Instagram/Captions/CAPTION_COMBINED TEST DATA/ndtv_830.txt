A 25-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut has created a piquant situation for the police by insisting that she wants to stay in the house of her 16-year-old lover and will marry him. She had befriended the boy on social media. The minor's family in Shamli claimed the woman had been staying in their house for the past few days and when she was asked to leave, she threatened to kill herself.
