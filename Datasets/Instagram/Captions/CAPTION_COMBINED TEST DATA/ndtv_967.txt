History is full of incidents that show people's courage and resilience. But there are very few stories that shine as brightly as that of Vesna Vulovic. Her remarkable journey from tragedy to triumph serves as a testament to the indomitable human spirit.

Ms Vulovic was working as a flight attendant onboard JAT Yugoslav Airlines' Flight 367 on January 26, 1972, when a suspected bomb brought down the plane among the mountains over Czechoslovakia - now known as the Czech Republic.

All 27 other passengers and crew died but Ms Vulovic survived.
